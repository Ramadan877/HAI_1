[2025-06-25 15:42:36] AI (Moderators): It looks like your explanation of the concept is a bit unclear. Can you try to elaborate a bit more on what moderators are and how they function in the context of relationships between variables? Think about how they might influence the strength or direction of those relationships. I'm here to help you refine it!
